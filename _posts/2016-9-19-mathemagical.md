I was listening to Arthur Benjamin speak on Cara Santa Maria's podcast, Talk Nerdy, about his passion for mathematics. In it, he discussed a way to teach Algebra to students by first presenting them with a magic trick (Or mathemagic trick if you will). It goes like this: 


>Pick a number between 1 - 10, but don't tell me the number. 

Uhh, 7! 

>Double the number. 

Okay, 14. 

>Now add ten. 

Alright, 24. 

>Divide it by 2. 

Hmm, 12. 

>Subtract the number you originally started with. 

Sure thing, 5. 

>Is the number you're currently thinking of 5? 

Ahh! It is! Pretty neat.  

At this point most people realize that this number will always be five. Curious kids will typically want to know why it's always 5. Of course, we can then explain it using Algebra.  

I feel like this is the perfect introduction to Algebra and wish I was introduced to it this way. It's a very hands-on approach to what Algebra is capable of. It stimulates curiousity in the student and makes it immediately clear that Algebra is *powerful*. After being tricked, most people will want to know why and how they were tricked. Algebra; Algebra is why they were tricked.  
 
For people who already know Algrebra, this mathemagic trick is just a basic equation. 

{% highlight algebra %}
((2N + 10) / 2) - N
{% endhighlight %}

Which always equals 5 for every positive integer N. Like I said, very basic Algebra, but to someone who has never been introduced to Algebra, it is unsolvable. Until you learn the rules, it is simply gibberish. But this mathemagic trick could make a student eager to learn the power Algebra in just the short amount of time it takes to perform it.  

I'm happy there are teachers like Arthur Benjamin in the world sparking curiousity in students and teaching awesome ways to make learning cool again.
