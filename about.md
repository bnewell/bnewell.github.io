Relabit is the official Internet home of Benjamin S. Newell. Who is Benjamin Newell? Well, for one, I am someone who doesn't typically refer to himself in the third person. So we'll start by nixing that.

I am a software developer living in Jacksonville, Florida. While developing software is my profession and a hobby, I also make time for many other things. I enjoy spending time with my wife, lounging on the beach, surfing tubular waves, reading good books, learning new things, solving puzzles, and creating useful things. I am always up for a new challenge or adventure.
